         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:106030:3"/>been many times told and perſwaded to believe, that the former pieces have been welcome, <hi>and done ſome good,</hi> as may in part be evinced from the ſeveral Impreſſions of them, I was willing to hope the like ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs for theſe; <hi>and the more,</hi> for that to moſt of the Sentences I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Scriptures to make them the more clear and forcible, which is an advantage the others had not.

                  <p>I muſt acknowledg that I do not make an Entertainment for, nor do I intend to treat the Profeſſors of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry and Wit; and therefore I do not preſent either a Romance or a Play-Book, but ſome little plain hints and helps for them that have
<pb facs="tcp:106030:4"/>a mind to be ſeriouſly good, that they may learn <hi>(which is difficult, though not impoſſible)</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their thoughts and to do well, and ſo acquit themſelves, not only as Profeſſors, but as them that are poſſeſt of, and live in the practice of piety. 'Tis but a little Book, which will not require much time or money to be ſpent about it, and may ſerve for more and better uſes, than a meer diverſion when thou haſt a little leaſure and a mind to be alone, whether at home or abroad, if thou do peruſe it.

                  <p>For the more clear and full diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of what is contain'd in this Text, I ſhall obſerve this Method.</p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:106030:85"/>
                  <p> Firſt, To ſhew what <hi>Holineſs</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That <hi>Holineſs</hi> is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and incomparable <hi>Beauty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That this <hi>Holineſs</hi> becomes the Houſe of God, and that for ever.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To acquaint you what <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is, as to the true notion and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it; which I ſhall not gather from the notation or <hi>Ftymology</hi> of the word, but from what the <hi>Oracles</hi> of Truth deſcribe it to be. And that,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively</hi> or <hi>excluſively,</hi> as to what it is not, but excludes and ſtands in oppoſition to: 'Tis in the general oppoſed to and excludes uncleanneſs, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.7. <hi>God hath not called us unto uncleanneſs, but unto helineſs.</hi> Yea, it excludes not only all filthineſs of the fleſh, but that of the Spirit alſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. As perfect love, or a <hi>Plerophory</hi> and full Aſſurance, caſteth out doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and fear, which hath torment: So perfect <hi>holineſs</hi> hath no communion with, but caſteth out all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes them Synonymous and equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106030:85"/>expreſſions, to be <hi>holy</hi> and to be without blame: So 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.13. he prays, that they may be unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in <hi>holineſs.</hi> And again, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.22. <hi>holy,</hi> unblameable, and unreprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, are in conjunction. The ſame S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that the reaſon why Chriſt ſo loved the Church as to give himſelf for it, was, that he might ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſie and cleanſe it, and ſo preſent it a glorious Church, <hi>not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it might be holy and without blemiſh.</hi> And as this is the deſcription of the Church Chriſts Spouſe, ſo 'tis of Chriſt the Churches Husband, the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> that died for her, that he was <hi>holy,</hi> harmleſs, undeſiled, and ſeparate from ſinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. We ſee then that <hi>holineſs</hi> excludes uncleanneſs and all filthineſs, is unblameable, without ſpot or blemiſh, undefiled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thus far 'tis amiable, and a <hi>moſt</hi> becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing. But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Affirmatively &amp; Comprehenſively.</hi> Holineſs is conformity to God; which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106030:86"/>is not meerly or only a being ſeparated, devoted and dedicated to God, but anſwering the end of ſuch Dedication, which is to be conformable and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him; for to be <hi>holy</hi> and to be acceptable, are joyn'd together with conformity to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12, 1, 2. Sin and <hi>holineſs</hi> are contraries; that therefore being non-conformity and contrariety to God, this muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and agreeableneſs to his Will. So that to be <hi>holy</hi> is to do all things ſuitably and acceptably to God, to do all things <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, decently, and in order, juſt as God would have them done; to do all things to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and to pleaſe God to the utmoſt. 'Tis true, that <hi>Holineſs</hi> is gradual, in ſome more, in ſome leſs; but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 'tis, 'tis lovely in any and in any degree, but moſt of all in the higheſt Degree. And this leads me to the</p>
                  <p>Second thing to be treated of and repreſented to you, <hi>viz.</hi> the abſolute and <hi>incomparable beauty of holineſs:</hi> and that 1. poſitively conſidered,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106030:86"/>which will be evinced and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſix things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, 'Tis the Name of God; and as his Name is, ſo is he, <hi>The Holy One, Iſa.</hi> 57.15. And how excellent is his Name in all the earth! He is called the <hi>Holy One,</hi> and the <hi>Holy One of Iſrael,</hi> many a time over in the Scriptures. His <hi>Holineſs</hi> is himſelf; for to ſwear by his <hi>Holineſs</hi> and by himſelf, is the ſame thing, as 'tis alſo to ſwear by his Great Name, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.35. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.26. compared. Now God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the altogether lovely, how beautiful a thing muſt <hi>Holineſs</hi> be! it being the Name of him who only is God, who only is good, who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is wiſe, and all that is the perfection of beauty, and object of deſires.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Holineſs is the Will of God;</hi> and as his Will is <hi>holy,</hi> ſo his Will is that we ſhould be <hi>holy.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> bids us <hi>in every thing give thanks, for this is the Will of God in Chriſt Jeſus concerning you,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.18. So may I ſay, In every thing be <hi>holy,</hi> for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106030:87"/>this is the Will of God in Chriſt Jeſus concerning you. His Word is the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification and diſcovery of his Will, and this is his Will, your ſanctification or <hi>holineſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.3. And this is his word too, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>As he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all manner of converſation; for it is written, Be ye holy, becauſe I am holy.</hi> O what a lovely and beautiful thing is the Will of God! He worketh all things according to the Counſel of his Will, and ſo ſhould we. 'Twas the great commendation of King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> that he ſerved his Generation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.36. and is for this ſaid to be the man after Gods own heart, becauſe he would fulfil all his Wills, for the <hi>Greek</hi> is plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.22. Yea, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is ſo often called <hi>The holy Jeſus.</hi> gloryed in this (becauſe by it he glorified his Father) that he did, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes did, and delighted to do, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> things that pleaſed him, or, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> all one, his Fathers Will. Well the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:106030:87"/>the Will of God being the Rule and meaſure of what's acceptable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, lovely and beautiful in his eyes, <hi>Holineſs</hi> muſt be tranſcendently ſo, for this is the Will of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Holineſs is the Work of God.</hi> All Gods works are worthy of him, and like himſelf, rare and excellent to admiration and wonder: The Rule holds here <hi>(operari ſequitur eſſe)</hi> in this ſenſe, the work is according to the worker. If <hi>Apelles</hi>'s and <hi>Titian</hi>'s Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were ſo admirable, what are Gods! If the works of the firſt Creation were good exceedingly, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. of which Man was one of the chief and <hi>holineſs</hi> the chief excellency of Man; how much more the work of the new Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which doth mainly conſiſt in <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs!</hi> He that hath wrought us to this ſelf ſame thing is God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. and he that ſanctifies, or makes us <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> is the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.13. <hi>We are his Workmanſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which God hath before ordained, that we ſhould walk in them,</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:106030:88"/>Eph. 2.10. <hi>And put on the New-Man, which after God is created in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and true holineſs.</hi> So that <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> being the work of God, it muſt needs be lovely. Yea,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Holineſs</hi> is not only the Name, the Will, and the Work, but 'tis <hi>the Image of God and his likeneſs.</hi> The Image of God is not ſo much in our ſouls being a ſpirit, as being holy: The <hi>Devil</hi> is a Spirit, but far enough from being the Image of God. We were at firſt created in Gods Image, and after Gods likeneſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, 27. And the Apoſtle refers to this, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. in <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Created after God,</hi> i. e. after the Image and likeneſs of God, <hi>viz. in righteouſneſs and true holineſs.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus is the <hi>holy</hi> One, and we are to be conformed to the Image of him the Son of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. both in being <hi>holy,</hi> and in ſuffering with him for being ſo, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. as well as in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glorified. If I may allude to the Art of Limning, I would ſay, that <hi>an holy life is the Picture of Gods,</hi> though
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106030:88"/>not drawn perfectly and to the life; and I think the Apoſtle favours the expreſſion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18. ſpeaking of the Gentiles, that they were aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the life of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> from <hi>holineſs.</hi> And as to the workers of iniquity Chriſt Jeſus profeſſeth that he never knew them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Sin hath ſo altered and diſguiſed man from what he was when God made him, that God</hi> knows him not, <hi>owns him not for the man he made.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, 'Tis yet more, <hi>Holineſs is the very Nature of God.</hi> There are ſome Attributes that flow from the Will of God, as well as from his Nature, as Mercy; which he may ſuſpend and not exert, if ſo pleaſe him, and none can ſay unto him, <hi>Why doſt thou thus?</hi> But the Holy Scriptures tell us, that there are ſome Attributes which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a <hi>cannot</hi> be otherwiſe; God, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>cannot lie, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> deny himſelf, ſo <hi>cannot</hi> do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly: He is True, Juſt, Faithful, and Holy, and 'tis impoſſible he ſhould be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106030:89"/>otherwiſe. And 'tis of clear obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in the Holy Scripture, <hi>A Divine Nature and Perfect Holineſs are equivalent terms.</hi> Be pleas'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. whereby are given to us exceeding great (or, <hi>the greateſt</hi>) and precious promiſes, that by theſe you might be partakers of a Divine Nature, having eſcaped the polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or corruption that is in the World through luſt. Here you ſee that the deſign and end of the promiſes is to make us partakers of <hi>a Divine Nature.</hi> Now compare this with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. and there the uſe of the promiſes is to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holineſs: Having theſe promiſes</hi> (which according to St. <hi>Peters</hi> Phraſe, are the greateſt, for they are, that God will be a God and Father; and there's none greater to promiſe, as there was none greater to ſwear by, than himſelf:) <hi>Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit</hi> (which is the ſame with the corruption ſpoken of by St. <hi>Peter) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting holineſs, i. e.</hi> till we be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106030:89"/>throughout and perfectly, or in St. <hi>Peters</hi> phraſe, be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of a <hi>Divine Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Yet once more, <hi>Holineſs is not only</hi> the Name, the Will, the Work, the Image, and the Nature, <hi>but 'tis the Glory of God, Exod.</hi> 15.11. Who is like unto thee, <hi>glorious in holineſs!</hi> 'Tis his great Title of Honour; 'Tis the Glory of all his Attributes and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations; it is the Attribute, whereby God is declared to be free from all impurity and imperfection: his Soveraignty would ſeem and look like Tyranny, but that 'tis <hi>holy;</hi> his Patience would look like an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Toleration of ſin (and ſo the World judge it, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.17.) but that 'tis <hi>holy;</hi> his Love would look like reſpecting of perſons, but that 'tis <hi>holy.</hi> Holineſs is the ground of the Songs of Praiſe that are ſung to his Glory in Earth and Heaven, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.3. Holy, holy, holy <hi>is the Lord of Hoſts, the whole Earth is full of his glory;</hi> which is repeated, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.8. Holy,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106030:90"/>holy, holy <hi>Lord God Almighty, which was and is, and is to come.</hi> This then that is the glory of God, muſt needs be the perfection of the creatures beauty, and ſo it will be found to be; for 'tis more to the glory of Angels that they are <hi>holy,</hi> than that they are wiſe and mighty. <hi>Zion</hi> was called the Perfection of beauty, but 'twas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of her being <hi>holineſs</hi> to the Lord: the Spouſe, the faireſt among Women, becauſe ſhe was <hi>undefiled:</hi> and the Church is called glorious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>holy</hi> and without blemiſh. 'Tis the glory of Gods Sabbath, that 'tis an <hi>holy</hi> Day: and of his Commandments, that they are all <hi>holy:</hi> and ſo of all his Judgements too. What wants <hi>holineſs</hi> cannot be, what is <hi>holy</hi> cannot but be, glorious, according to it's degree.</p>
                  <p>Among all the things that have been or are famous for any perfection, <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> bears the bell: and though many have been juſtly celebrated, and their renown hath been ſpread abroad, for their beauty, yet this of <hi>Holineſs</hi>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:106030:90"/>excells them all. You will find many high ſounding words joyn'd with beauty; as <hi>Glory</hi> and Beauty, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.2. and 40. <hi>Job</hi> 40.10. <hi>Joy</hi> attends it, but to ſee it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.2. <hi>Praiſe</hi> attends it, as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.25. <hi>Excellency, Iſa.</hi> 13.19. <hi>Ornament, Ezek.</hi> 7.20. <hi>Renown, Ezek.</hi> 16.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Beauty of <hi>Holineſs</hi> exceeds them all, and the reſt is as a thing of naught where this is not. That which may ſeem ſtrange is, you may hear a Woman and a <hi>Queen</hi> calling it <hi>Vanity, Prov.</hi> 31.30. <hi>Favour is deceitful, and Beauty vain; but a Woman that feareth the Lord, ſhe ſhall be prais'd.</hi> For what? <hi>For a Beauty.</hi> Her own works (ſuch as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. in the language of my Text, <hi>becoming Women profeſſing Godlineſs.) Her good Works ſhall praiſe her in the Gate.</hi> All the other glorious beauty is but <hi>a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding flower,</hi> Iſa. 28.14. but this is the laſting and abiding beauty, even for ever, as in the Text, as in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.24. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.6, 7. One rebuke of God,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106030:91"/>if he do but blow upon it, makes the moſt glaring beauty to conſume like a moth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.11. yea of its ſelf 'tis in a conſumption and dying daily. But wickedneſs makes not only the perſon, but the beauty to be abhorred; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.25. There is more uglineſs in the ſin, than there can be beauty in or on the perſon of a ſinner, though an <hi>Abſalom</hi> among men, a very None-Such, or a <hi>Bathſheba</hi> among Women, who was very beautiful, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.2. The glory of young men is their ſtrength, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.29. <hi>What to do wickedly?</hi> no, but when ſuch young men as St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.14. who were ſtrong by the Word of God abiding in them, and overcame the evil and wicked one; ſo that this ſtrength of <hi>Holineſs</hi> is the true glory of young men. And they that pride themſelves and glory in their being mighty to drink, woe unto them, for <hi>they glory in their ſhame.</hi> As for old men, the ſame. Text <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.29. tells us, that the gray head is their beauty;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106030:91"/>but when? <hi>for it ſeems to need an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation:</hi> why then 'tis a crown of glory, <hi>viz.</hi> the hoary head, when 'tis found in a way of righteouſneſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.31. So that we ſee there is no glory allowed to any beauty, but that of <hi>Holineſs.</hi> We may conclude, as holy King <hi>David,</hi> I have ſeen an end of all perfection, but the perfection of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>that is,</hi> the beauty of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which is as exceeding broad, as all the Holy Commandments of God. Holy <hi>David</hi> was ſo taken with and inamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of this beauty, which is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God himſelf, that he begs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this (or nothing like this) of God in prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord, and that will I ſeek after</hi> (his heart is fully ſet and reſolved) <hi>that I may dwell in the Houſe of the Lord all the dayes of my life;</hi> what to do? <hi>to behold the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Lord:</hi> a ſight that paſſeth all ſights. And <hi>Moſes</hi> the man of God, prayes to ſee this glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.16, 17. <hi>Let thy work appear unto thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106030:92"/>and thy glory unto their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and let the</hi> beauty of the Lord <hi>our God be upon us, &amp;c.</hi> The truth of it is, to ſee the glory and beauty of the Lord is a ſight, not only worth praying, but worth dying for, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no leſs than the Beatifical Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>I perceive I have been engaged ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than I was aware of in the ſecond thing, <hi>the comparative conſideration of holineſs,</hi> and yet I muſt proceed and make further progreſs, to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence this, that nothing is worthy to be compared with her, but that her beauty is incomparable: There are many pretenders and competitors who are brought in by too many in this blinded world, to vie with <hi>holineſs:</hi> But if we will believe ſo clear, ſo great, and ſo juſt a judgement as that of Gods, <hi>The beauty of holineſs is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond compariſon and competition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. There have been and I am afraid there are (with a ſigh be it ſpoken to their ſhame) that prefer ſin before the

                     <hi>holy</hi> Jeſus, and ſay as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.2, 3. There is no beauty that we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him: they deſpiſe and reject him, they hide their faces from him, and have no eſteem for him; but ſay as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.11. <hi>Cauſe</hi> the Holy <hi>One of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael to ceaſe from before us:</hi> and as the Devils, <hi>Let us alone,</hi> or away, <hi>what have we to do with thee? art thou come to torment us? thou</hi> Holy <hi>One, Luke</hi> 4.34. Woe! and alas! that the alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lovely Jeſus ſhould be thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued! and that by them, whom he had infinitely obliged to ſerve and honour him! He had for us a love that <hi>paſſeth knowledge,</hi> ſuch as never was the like known, unexampled and never to be parallelled by any; great it was, like that of his Fathers, who ſent him into the World; from and in the ſtrength of this love he came, not only to make or give a Viſit, but to ſave us with a great Salvation, <hi>from ſin and wrath:</hi> and ſhall not this man rule over us? and be our Prince, who is our Saviour? Oh diſ-ingenious,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106030:93"/>ingrateful, fooliſh people and unwiſe, thus to requite the Lord with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, ſcorn, and hatred for his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will! what alles this degenerate wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed World? that they ſee not his glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of all Graces and Truth of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I muſt confeſs that the Son of God did appear with many ſeeming diſadvantages to ſenſual and ſinful eyes; for he being to take a journey into this World, where he was to taſte of death, diſ-robed himſelf of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Glory, becoming for a time not only little lower than the Angels, but was pleaſed to put on <hi>our Countrey Cloths,</hi> and came habited into the World like one of us, yea in the form of a ſervant, and in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh: And though it were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that he was God, yet without controverſie, 'tis one of the great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Godlineſs, that he was <hi>God</hi> manifeſt <hi>in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16.

Yet in truth this Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial and condeſcention of his, is that we are hugely beholden to him for; if he had not put on this Vail, <hi>we poor weak-eyed mortals could not have ſeen his face and live.</hi> This humbling of himſelf ſhould indear him to us, as it did unto his Father, who declared from Heaven that he was his Son, in whom he was well pleas'd, <hi>even now in this humane dreſſe,</hi> and while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the diſpatch of this Worlds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning affairs: yea, the Father did not only love him, becauſe he laid down his life, but did put the Cup into his hand, yea <hi>(and which is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous ſtrange)</hi> it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him.</p>
                  <p>This then methinks ſhould not be, nor indeed is it, either the only or greateſt cauſe that the <hi>holy</hi> Jeſus hath no more reſpect or eſteem; but alas, 'tis from hence, that ſuch <hi>men love their ſins more than their Saviour:</hi> This, this is the condemnation, that light, glorious and beautiful light is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106030:94"/>come into the world, but men, <hi>too too many men,</hi> love darkneſs and deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty more than Light and Beauty: but why? becauſe their deeds are evil. <hi>A goodly reaſon indeed!</hi> what ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have ſin'd? Will they love and hug their evil deeds, and with them damnation? Will they refuſe Salvation becauſe they have ſinned, and that not out of modeſty, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate willfulneſs; becauſe ſinned they have, ſin they will! <hi>Alas poor men!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I pray what is this ſin, that men are ſo much lovers of it? Is there any beauty or comlineſs why it ſhould be deſired? Ah no! As I would not, I need not call it out of its Name, for a worſe cannot be given it; <hi>'Tis ſuch a deformed ugly hag, as is more odious than Death or Devil.</hi> 'Tis impoſſible to rail at it, or to ſpeak bad enough of it; the worſt of words are too good to call it by; 'tis ſo vile and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable a thing, that <hi>no Name but its own is expreſſive of it;</hi> and yet, as if
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106030:94"/>that were not ſignificant enough, the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13. adds an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, to denote its <hi>hyperbolical</hi> and inexpreſſible vileneſs. 'Tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <gap reason="foreign">

'Tis not only the cauſe, but the Hell of Hell, and if there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>'twere damnation to be a ſinner;</hi> for as ſuch, he is ſeparated from God, and under a Curſe; and indeed ſin and damnation have one Name, they are both a ſeparation and departure from God. This alas, would you think it? is the thing (ſhall I ſay) that wicked and deviliſh men, and ſuch as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106030:95"/>the Jews of old, prefer before the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> of bleſſed Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>I cannot yet give over, but I muſt tell you, that this ſin which the World is ſo inamour'd of, is ſo rotten a thing, and hath ſo ſtinking a breath, that one cannot come near it without danger of being infected: Who can touch this pitch and not be defiled? 'Tis infinitely worſe and more conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious than the plague, and we ſhould abhor the garment ſpotted with this fleſh. The <hi>face</hi> of it hath not one good feature, the <hi>aire</hi> of it is gaſtly, its <hi>complexion</hi> is ſo like Hell, that 'twould fright any one that hath not loſt the eyes of his underſtanding: <hi>Mean</hi> or meaſure it hath none, 'tis altogether indecent and unſatiable, and is never quiet till it have ſent men to Hell, <hi>no nor there doth it leave them,</hi> but in its upbraids and torments is a continual fury and gnawing worme, yea, a fire that burns everlaſtingly. 'Tis the ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt thing that ever was, and moſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapen; all the auxiliary <hi>Artifices</hi> that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106030:95"/>can be uſed, cannot ſtraiten it, nor make it handſome. It's ſo aſhamed of it ſelf, that it dares not appear in its own colours, nor own its Name: it diſguiſeth it ſelf, ſo that its lovers lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle know with whom they have to do. <hi>If good were not called evil, it could not be hated; if evil were not called good, it could never be beloved.</hi> If Pride were not new-named Decency; Wantonneſs, Affability and Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance; Covetouſneſs, Frugality; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality, Generoſity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs were not nick-named Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; and a Fear to ſin, Cowardize and Puſilanimity; Holineſs, Preciſeneſs; and Faithfulneſs, Folly; I ſay, were it not that the Names are thus altered, it were impoſſible, but <hi>holineſs</hi> would be greatly deſired for her beauty; and ſin would be houted away and ſtoned to death; men would take revenge on it and themſelves too, repenting even in duſt and aſhes, that ever they were ſo mad to prefer ſin before <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>

We uſe to give ſuch an one the the name of an accompliſh't, lovely, obliging, and therefore an obtaining perſon. This way <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſtole more hearts, than his face raviſht eyes, as you may ſee, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.5, 6. but this is not ſo much to his praiſe, as his <hi>Treaſon</hi> is to his diſgrace. Civility without Sanctity, Ingenuity without Holineſs, is more pretty than preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: ſome call it <hi>ſplendidum peccatum</hi> a glittering ſin; but I ſhall only call it, a well-acted vanity, an inſignificant ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, an handſom nothing. <hi>To be accompliſht to ſerve a Prince, and not be accompliſh'd to ſerve a God, is no great commend to any man.</hi> To be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106030:96"/>lovely in the ſight of all men, and not to be lovely in the ſight of God, is a praiſe may ſit a Phariſee or an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, but will not content a godly man.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Holineſs excells,</hi> if compared with the charming and captivating <hi>beauty of faces.</hi> Alas, what is it to be fair as <hi>Abſolom,</hi> and celebrated as he beyond all others, and be branded for Murther and Treaſon? Tis far from a glory, to have beauty enough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame a Prince as <hi>Dinah</hi> had, and to be defiled as ſhe was. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Tyre</hi> that ſhe was perfect in beauty, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lifted up becauſe of her beauty, God caſt her down becauſe of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lifted up, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.17. for God had purpoſed to ſtain the pride of her glory, as was foretold, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23.9. <hi>Bathſheba</hi> was very beautiful to look upon, but her ſin was more her ſhame, than that her praiſe.</p>
                  <p>You heard before how this <hi>Beauty of Holineſs</hi> was prefer'd, and had the commendation beyond that of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106030:97"/>face, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.30. And the Apoſtle gives the <hi>holy</hi> hand, the honour above all, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. A white hand, if not innocent; a neat hand, if not holy; though adorned with never ſo many rings and bracelets, makes no fair ſhew in the eyes of God, though lifted up to him in Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Artificial beauty</hi> (which is ſhort of the Natural) muſt therefore of neceſſity fall ſhort of this which is <hi>Supernatural.</hi> The Ornaments of Gold and Silver, Garniſhings with Precious Stones for Beauty, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.6.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106030:97"/>beauty is in forgetting her fathers houſe, and in worſhipping her Lord and King, who would then deſire her beauty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.10, 11. for ſuch he ſeeks to worſhip him, as do it in ſpirit and truth, <hi>in the beauty of holineſs.</hi> So St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that the beſt ornaments are not broidered hair, or gold, or pearls, or coſtly array, but modeſty, ſhamefaſtneſs, ſobriety, and good works, <hi>which becometh women profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Godlineſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9, 10. That without this is nothing at all, but this, though without that, is all in all: <hi>And ſo St.</hi> Peter <hi>alſo tells us,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.3, 4. that women ſhould not reckon thoſe outward ornaments their beauty, but the hidden man of the heart, that which is not corruptible, a meek and quiet ſpirit, <hi>which is in the ſight of God of great price;</hi> and that's the praiſe we ſhould be ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of, <hi>viz.</hi> which is of God and not of men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29. To be dreſt to the approbation and admiration of men, to be renowned for beauty, and not to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106030:98"/>have the approbation of God, will afford but cold comfort, while we live and when we die. And therefore to declare the thing as it is, and to diſ-abuſe this miſtaken World, let me tell them that they do but miſ-call and flatter theſe ſublunary things, when they attribute to them, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn them with the fine words and ſpecious titles, of beauty and brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, delight and delicacy, pleaſure and prettineſs, honour and happineſs; alas theſe are but great fancies, pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous ſhews, glittering and gaudy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things. The <hi>roſineſs</hi> of the moſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent beauty, the <hi>whiſtling</hi> of the moſt ſilken bravery, the <hi>chinking</hi> of white and yellow duſt, <hi>alias</hi> gold and ſilver, the <hi>ſparkling</hi> glories, which tempt and captivate, the amorous, the proud, the covetous, the ambitious ſons of men, will one day appear to be but the cheat of imagination; and that they who have courted them, have jugled themſelves out of true happineſs into a falſe one, and have
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106030:98"/>eſpouſed themſelves to a meer paul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try vanity; which if it be any thing, is <hi>a ſomething leſs than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> as the Prophet phraſeth it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.17. they will find by the diſappointment of their hopes, that they did but build Caſtles in the aire, and their falſe joys will end in true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Holineſs far ſurmounts the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi> and half refined Vertues of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. Morality is indeed a very lovely thing in its kind, and is a great rarity among men; 'twere to be wiſht there were as much among ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as there was among ſome Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens: <hi>Chriſtians profeſs more than they did, but they did more than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who are profeſt-Chriſtians.</hi> For this Chriſt loved the young man, but yet 'twas not enough, <hi>the one thing neceſſary was wanting,</hi> he was not ſanctified. There are many fine things, that may glitter, but be no gold; good inclinations, ſweet diſpoſitions, ingenious behaviour, ſeemingly vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106030:99"/>converſations may make a fair ſhew in the fleſh, and yet they who own them may be in the fleſh, and ſo cannot pleaſe God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexional or a conſtitutional meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be no vertue (which is a conqueſt over oppoſition.) Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Vertue, which they place in obeying and conforming to the Placits of wiſe men and dictates of Reaſon, or performing vertuous acts for vertues ſake, may be far from <hi>holineſs,</hi> which is as I clear'd above, a conformity to the will of God, as ſuch, <hi>(ſub intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu divinae voluntatis)</hi> with reſpect to his will and an eye to his glory. Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Art and Prudence may and do oblige to and produce effects very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling and like to them that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious; but the ſweeteſt innocency and moſt glorious acts, if not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and effect of union with Chriſt and the love of God, will profit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. Though ſuch perſons may ſeem too good to go to Hell, yet without holineſs, they will
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106030:99"/>not be found good enough to go to Heaven: but the perſon may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnable, when the acts may be, by themſelves conſidered, capable of commendation. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21, 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>Yet again as to this head, <hi>To teach or learn Moral Vertues apart from Chriſt, is to have them apart from Heaven:</hi> they are indeed required of and to be practis'd by Chriſtians, but ſo is more than they; and they, as ſpringing from the fountain, directed by the rule, and terminated in the glory of God in Chriſt: Otherwiſe though we learn to conceal or diſguiſe Ungodlineſs, we ſhall never learn to be godly, and <hi>every thing but being and living godly in Chriſt Jeſus, leaves us under the firſt Covenant, which is too weak to ſave us.</hi> Philoſophy and Morality may make us civil and good men, but they will never make us ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and good Chriſtians. And as Doctor <hi>M. Cauſabon</hi> well obſerves, Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs diſcourſes are to little purpoſe;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106030:100"/>the truth is <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt laid aſide, though good language, and excellency of wit may go far with ſome men to perſwade, and with all or moſt to pleaſe and delight; yet bare vertue of it ſelf, all things ſoberly conſidered, will prove gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally but a weak plea, and (as <hi>Brutus</hi> at his death is ſaid to have bemoan'd himſelf) rather a Name, or Word, than reality.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. and Laſtly, <hi>The Beauty of holineſs far exceeds and excells Phariſaical righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> The <hi>Phariſees,</hi> if you would take their word, and believe of them as they conceited of themſelves, were righteous more than others; and therefore deſpiſed others, and bid them ſtand afar off, as unclean in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of them the more holy; but theſe were no incenſe, only ſmoak in the noſtrils of God. They had ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd upon the credulous and eaſily deluded Vulgar, that they alſo thought them Gods darlings and favourites, in ſo much that 'twas Proverbial among
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106030:100"/>the many, <hi>That if but two went to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the one would be a Phariſee.</hi> Our Saviour acknowledgeth, that to weak and dim-ſighted eyes they did appear beautiful, but to him who had an all-ſeeing eye, they were the <hi>moſt errant Hypocrites</hi> in the world, a Generation of Vipers, that could not <hi>without a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle</hi> eſcape the damnation of Hell. And therefore he tells his Diſciples and all others moſt aſſuredly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.20. <hi>That except their Righteouſneſs</hi> exceed <hi>that of the Scribes and Phariſees, they can in no caſe enter into the Kingdome of Heaven; no, in no wiſe,</hi> 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>It will be worth our while to take a more particular view of their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much or exceſſive, and yet defective righteouſneſs. 1. <hi>They were great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Religion,</hi> but were more ſo in words than works; for though they did in words confeſs, yet in works they did deny God and Godlineſs, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.3, 4. The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> Seat, <hi>All therefore
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106030:101"/>whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that ye obſerve and do; but do not after their works, for they ſay and do not:</hi> They bind heavy burdens, and griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to be born, and lay them on other mens ſhoulders, but they themſelves will not touch them with one of their Fingers. And what they do, <hi>'tis in hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie,</hi> For all their works they do to be ſeen of men. 2. Of all the Sects (for there were many) <hi>they were the moſt preciſe, ſtrict, and exquiſite.</hi> As the Apoſtle, who was once of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, doth confeſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.45. And 'twas for this that they were ſo much admired; not for their Learning, their Wit, or Eloquence, but for their righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, yet this is the thing our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour cenſures and condemns in them, and on great and juſt cauſes. For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>'Twas but external and in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</hi> They were like whited or painted Sepulchres, which appear beautiful outward; but were like them within too, for they were rotten and filthy, full of hypocriſie and iniquity,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106030:101"/>
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.27, 28. And therefore our Saviour ſaith unto them, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. <hi>Ye are they which juſtifie your ſelves before men, but God knows your hearts;</hi> and that your appearing righteouſneſs, which is but in ſhew, though it be highly eſteemed among men, is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>'Twas but their own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> which is of the Law, not that which is through the Faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith. Thus the ſame Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>Touching the Law,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I was a Phariſee,</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>and as to the righteouſneſs which is in the Law, blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> verſ. 6. and yet counted this but loſs and dung, <hi>v.</hi> 8. that he might win Chriſt, and be found in him, not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Legal righteouſneſs, <hi>(which was all he had as a Phariſee, and was all that the Phariſees had)</hi> but that he might have the righteouſneſs which is through Faith; for without that, which infinitely exceeds the other of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> he believ'd
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106030:102"/>what our Saviour ſaid, <hi>That he could not enter into heaven, or be ſaved.</hi> Yet,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees was but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the outſide and Letter of the Law,</hi> as Matth. 5. our Saviour gives us to underſtand. If they did not actually murther, or commit adultery, cauſleſs anger and luſting after a woman in their heart, were to them no tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſious of the Law. They had the Law in their hands and mouth, but not in their heart: <hi>but they are the people that know righteouſneſs, the people in whoſe heart my Law is,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.7. And therefore our Saviour reflects this upon them with a woe, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.25. <hi>Te make clean the outſide of the Cup and the Platter, but within they are full of extortion and exceſs. Mens Legis eſt Lex,</hi> the meaning of the Law is the Law; but this they had no mind to.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Their righteouſneſs as to the Law, was but an obſervance of ſome of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106030:102"/>the Commandments of God,</hi> for many of them they did tranſgreſs, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour taxeth them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.3. but then 'tis that we ſhall not be aſhamed, when we have reſpect to all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. and are like that renowned pair, <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Luke 1.6. who were both righteous in the ſight of God, walking in all the Commandements and Ordinances of God without blame. Yea,</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees as to the Law, <hi>was placed in Rituals and Poſitives,</hi> the leſſer things of the Law, and that with neglect of the real and moſt weighty things; as 'tis clear from what our Saviour reprehends and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt curſes them for, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.23. <hi>Woe to you Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, <hi>for ye pay tythe of Mint, Annis and Cummin, but have omitted the weightter matters of the Law, Judgement, Mercy, Faith, and</hi> (Luke 11.42.) <hi>the Love of God:</hi> theſe ought
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106030:103"/>ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. They were moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionably unjuſt and oppreſſive, while they pretended conſcience: and thought that theſe little ceremonial obſervances would make amends for all their greater wickedneſs and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly and laſtly, as to this head, <hi>Their conformity was not ſo much to the Law, as to their and their Elders Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon and Interpretation of the Law.</hi> I confeſs at ſuch eaſie and cheap rates men may paſs for blameleſs (as blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous and injurious <hi>Saul</hi> did) and be pretenders to, yea profeſſors of perfection: They owned the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but prefer'd the Traditions of the Elders <hi>(as the Papiſts do unwritten ones)</hi> before them: And as the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> advance the Dictates of <hi>Pope</hi> and Councils before the written Word of God; ſo theſe uſed to ſay, that the words of the wiſe, had more in them than the words of the Law. For this our Saviour takes them up roundly,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106030:103"/>and rebukes them cuttingly as they deſerved, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. and lets them know, that thereby they did worſe than tranſgreſs, for they made void the Commands of God, and render'd them of little uſe and none effect: <hi>Ye Hypocrites,</hi> well did <hi>Eſaias</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of you and your ill doing, ſaying, <hi>This people draweth nigh me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me; and in vain do they worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines the commandments of men.</hi> Thus we ſee that the whole frame of theſe mens Religion, was more of their own deviſing and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning, than in conforming to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions and Commandments of God, <hi>and was indeed but an Apiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mockery of the true and ſound Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Except therefore your righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs exceed, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to proceed: 3. <hi>They were very Orthodox and ſound in many of their Tenets</hi> beyond the Sadduces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They held the Immortality of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106030:104"/>Soul, and Reſurrection of the Body, but lived ſo ſenſually as if neither were true; and as if they prefer'd the uppermoſt rooms at a feaſt, before the Kingdom and Glory of Heaven. They held, That there was One and but One God, and were right as to pure <hi>Deiſme,</hi> but God in Chriſt they could not bear; 'twas beyond their patience to hear of Chriſt to be the Son of God; and though 'twere for life, yet they would not come to him. Now 'tis not eternal life to know the only true God, unleſs we know the Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. And <hi>the excellency of knowing Chriſt,</hi> is to know him ſo as to be found in him, to have communion with him, and be made conformable to him. If we will believe St. <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>He that</hi> thus <hi>hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the Son, hath not life,</hi> 1 John 5.12. <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting life, and he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life; but the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:106030:104"/>John 3.36. He was a child of wrath by Nature, and if he believe not in the Son of God, he is ſtill a child of wrath, and liable to condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>But to make haſte with the reſt of their Characters, <hi>They were much and long in prayer;</hi> but though they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led often on his Name, they departed not from iniquity; but went from their prayers to their ſins, yea, made their prayers but for their ſins ſake, and for a pretence, that they might the more glibly ſwallow down and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <hi>(the hard to be digeſted)</hi> Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows-houſes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. Their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were but a ſhew, they ſinned in the Name of the Lord, and at the coſt and charges of Divinity, wretches that they were.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They did not only pray, but faſt too;</hi> they had learnt the Art of making ſad and ſowre faces, and of hanging down the head like a bulruſh; yea, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ſo expert at and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in it, as if this more than any
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106030:105"/>thing elſe were their Maſter-piece, and ſuper-errogating (I might ſay <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-arrogant</hi>) excellency: they do not only plead it with God, as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.12. but as a merit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3. as if they deſerved a Feaſt in Heaven, for their faſting on Earth.</p>
                  <p>To their Faſting and Prayer, <hi>they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Almes alſo:</hi> and that it might not be an unknown charity, <hi>(though God and the poor be the beſt witneſſes and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough)</hi> they ſounded a trumpet, and were not content that their left hand knew what their right hand did, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were alſo ſeen of men, which they minded much more than doing good, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.1, 2. for they were extreamly covetous <hi>(which no pious man is charged with or ſound guilty of in all the Scripture)</hi> yet as covetous as they were, they were more ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and parted with money, that they might have a reward of praiſe and glory from men.</p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:106030:105"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Zealous they were too</hi> (beyond all reaſon and religion) <hi>for the Sabbath;</hi> but concern'd themſelves more for an Oxe or an Aſſe, than for the health of mens bodies, or the ſaving-health of mens ſouls, which is an undeniable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of their hypocriſie, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet to do them right, and to give theſe Devils their due, <hi>they took great pains to make Proſelites,</hi> for they compaſs Sea and Land (<hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans-walk,</hi> as the late learned <hi>Biſhop Hall</hi> calls it, on this very place and occaſion) not to convert men to God, but to make a party of them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and a prey to the Devil; and did nothing but undo themſelves, and to make their Proſelites two-fold more the children of Hell than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.15.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have endeavoured to clear up the <hi>Beauty of Holineſs,</hi> and do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow it againſt all gain-ſayers to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable. You cannot but from all this learn to believe, that all pleaſures <hi>without holineſs</hi> are but griefs; and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106030:106"/>the pleaſures of ſin will be found ſo, either in repenting of, or being dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for them: That all profit <hi>without holineſs</hi> is but loſs; <hi>for what will it profit a man to gain the World, and</hi> (He that pays but a ſin for it buys it too dear, for he wrongs and is in danger) <hi>to loſe his ſoul?</hi> Honour <hi>without holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> will end, and that in diſgrace. Civility, Gentility, Morality, Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Righteouſeſs, the greateſt and all the beauty that is in the World, will never admit any perſon to a ſight of God <hi>without holineſs;</hi> and they that miſs that ſight, miſs Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome captious and trifling objections, which this blind and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore peeviſh and quarrelſome World make againſt <hi>holineſs;</hi> but I ſhall not trouble you with them, they being clear and invincible arguments, that though they may have ſeen her <hi>(in tranſitu)</hi> in her humane dreſſe here below among men (which is diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to her, being nothing ſo
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106030:106"/>glorious as that ſhe is cloth'd with and wears above with God and Angels) yet that they never view'd her with intellectual or believing eyes, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the happineſs of her ennobling heavenly and happyfying converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for then they would undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be tranſported and rapt with her admirable and tranſcending Beauty, which would not only oblige and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but inſpire and enable them to cry out with the <hi>Queen of Sheba</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the wiſdom and glory of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.6, <hi>&amp;c. It was a true report, that I heard of thine Acts and of thy Wiſdome, howbeit I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd not the words, until I came and mine eyes had ſeen; and behold,</hi> the half was not told me; <hi>thy Wiſdom and Proſperity exceedeth the fame which I heard: Happy are thy men! happy be thy ſervants! Bleſſed be the Lord thy God, who hath ſet thee on the Throne, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſee it is now high time to take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our thoughts the third thing which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106030:107"/>I promiſed to treat of and entertain you a little with, which is, that this lovely thing, <hi>The beauty of holineſs, becometh the Houſe of God, and that for ever.</hi> Here I have two things to do:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To inform you what is meant by the Houſe of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Holineſs becomes the Houſe of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>For the Houſe of God.</hi> This Pſalme having no title in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> (though the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and thence the vulgar <hi>Latine</hi> give it one) we can ſpeak nothing but conjecturally, as to the occaſion, date or Author of it; and 'tis better to ſay nothing, than what is doubtful. Some would raiſe this <hi>Houſe of God</hi> as high as Heaven, which is indeed called the Houſe of God, <hi>John</hi> 14.2. and the beauty of this Houſe is <hi>holineſs, Iſa.</hi> 57.15. <hi>I dwell in the High and Holy Place;</hi> and yet this high and holy God is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleas'd to prefer the little low cottage, <hi>this country houſe,</hi> of an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106030:107"/>and broken heart, before that Throne of his; indeed in this Text, 'tis but <hi>with him alſo,</hi> but <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.1. 'tis prefer'd before it.</p>
                  <p>Others as to the Letter refer it to the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> the little Ambulatory and moving Temple in the Wilderneſs, and after; or to the <hi>Temple,</hi> the great and fixed Tabernacle at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was famed for beauty, yea the <hi>beauty of holineſs,</hi> by which Name 'tis often called: But as I remember, the Jews of Old and Latter Time do grant that this is one of the Pſalms, which relates and belongs to the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah-Time,</hi> which our Divines do ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally call the Goſpel-Time or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation. And by this Houſe of God, is by moſt, if not all interpreters, meant and underſtood the People, or Servants, or Houſhold of God. <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> and <hi>Clarius</hi> (who often tranſcribes <hi>Munſter</hi> word for word) expreſs it thus, <hi>Per Domum ornatam &amp; perpetuo perſtituram, intellige fidelium Eccleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am;</hi> By this adorned Houſe which is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106030:108"/>to endure for ever, they underſtand the Church of the Faithful. <hi>Doctor M. Cauſabon</hi> in theſe words; holineſs actively, that is all manner of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in outward performances and duties; but eſpecially <hi>an holy life</hi> and converſation becometh them, that profeſs themſelves to be ſervants to ſo great and glorious a Majeſty. And the Apoſtles, both St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſpeak of the Houſe and Temple of God in theſe expreſſions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God? The Temple of God is</hi> holy, <hi>which Temple ye are,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Ye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as lively ſtones are built up a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual houſe;</hi> ſo that the Houſe is <hi>the Houſhold</hi> or Family of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Holineſs,</hi> all and all manner of holineſs <hi>becomes</hi> all and every one of <hi>the houſes of God:</hi> 'Tis their deſire and delight, their beauty and comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as the word imports, and is ſo render'd by both <hi>Jewiſh and Chriſtian</hi> Interpreters. <hi>Holineſs</hi> of Doctrine and Worſhip, of heart and life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106030:108"/>the houſes of God; not only becomes them as their duty to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but being holy is their comlineſs; <hi>'Tis their greateſt ornament and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in the eyes of God, Angels, and all good men.</hi> As to fear God and keep his Commandments is the whole or all (as duty, ſo happineſs) of man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppoſed to all the reſt, which the wiſeſt of Men and Kings properly and ſignificantly calls <hi>Vanity and vexation of ſpirit:</hi> ſo <hi>holineſs</hi> is the all of their beauty and excellency in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction from the other exteriour or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments.</p>
                  <p>I told you before, that other beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had many a great and big word at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to it, but we may allow them much more to be the Titles of Honour belonging to this <hi>Beauty of Holineſs:</hi> This then is the <hi>Glory,</hi> the <hi>Joy,</hi> the <hi>Praiſe,</hi> the <hi>Excellency,</hi> the <hi>Diadem,</hi> the <hi>Crown,</hi> the <hi>Ornament,</hi> the <hi>Renown,</hi> the <hi>Perfection</hi> of Beauty. Doth not the Holy Spirit, who indited the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture tell us ſo? and what need we
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106030:109"/>any further witneſs? If 'twere ſaid but once by the Infallible Truth, yet it were as true, as if ſaid an hundred times over; and he that believes not one, would not in likelihood believe ten or ten times ten quoted Scriptures, though backt with the concurring Suffrages and Authorities of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Expoſitors, which the Holy Scripture needs not, and therefore I ſhall not urge them: Only to indear the argument, and by that the thing, <hi>viz. Holineſs,</hi> 'tis worthy of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that the Pen-man of this Text utters it by way of admiration <hi>(O Lord!)</hi> which indeed ſpeaks the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakableneſs of it: Oh <hi>how</hi> amiable! <hi>How</hi> lovely! <hi>How</hi> beautiful! <hi>How</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming is Holineſs! and <hi>how</hi> doth it become thine Houſe, <hi>O Lord!</hi> There's want in the words that are, and need of more words than there are, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it according to its worth and perfection. And ſo in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we may obſerve St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, with an admiration beyond
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106030:109"/>what he could utter, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11. <hi>What manner of perſons ought ye to be, in all holy converſations and godlineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes!</hi> for ſo the reading is in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Greek: not only ſingle holineſs and godlineſs, but plurality, holy converſations and godlineſſes; and that with an univerſality, <hi>all</hi> holy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea with admiration too <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>quanti-quales, What manner,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Having thus diſpatcht theſe three things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The diſcovery of what Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is, in its proper Notion and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Secondly, That it is an abſolute and incomparable beauty. Thirdly, That it becomes and is the chiefeſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of every Houſe of God, both above and here below. I may come to the Application in the language of St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8.31. <hi>What ſhall we then ſay to theſe things?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay by way of Inference and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, That, <hi>Sin doth not become, but is the diſgrace and reproach of the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106030:110"/>Houſe of God.</hi> Our bleſſed Lord and Saviour had not patience (the Zeal of his Fathers Houſe did ſo poſſeſs and eat him up) to behold the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the <hi>Houſe of Prayer and Holineſs,</hi> to be turn'd into a Den of Thieves; he could not bear it, nor endure the ſight, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.12, 13. When he found in the Temple thoſe that ſold Oxen and Sheep, and Doves, and the Changers of Money ſitting, he made a Scourge of ſmall cords and drove them all out of the Temple, and ſaid, Take theſe things hence, and make not my Fathers Houſe, <hi>an Houſe of Merchandiſe.</hi> Certainly ſuch things, as lofty and ſcorning <hi>Pride,</hi> griping and ſordid <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <hi>Lukewarmneſs,</hi> un-manning <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> beaſtial <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, &amp;c.</hi> are the ſpots, which diminiſh and diſparage the beauty of the Houſe of God, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be imagined that they who are enemies to holineſs, can be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106030:110"/>friends to, or lovers of God. They that live in ſin, whoſe practiſe and delight is to do wickedly, are ſo far from being the Houſe of God, that they are but a Cage of unclean birds; and like to that houſe, which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil calls his own, though 'twere ſwept and garniſht, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.44. To hate holineſs, and to be in love with ſin, is by interpretation and true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, <hi>to be in love with Hell, and to hate Heaven,</hi> or to be in love with miſery, and to hate happineſs.</p>
                  <p>This is that which opens the mouths of <hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> againſt the Chriſtian Religion; and, as by the Jews of Old, the Name of God and Chriſt is evil ſpoken of by reaſon of theſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.23, 24. who by their evil deeds give great occaſion to the enemies of <hi>our beſt friend</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to blaſpheme his Name. The Chriſtian Religion is <hi>Magnetical</hi> and attractive, 'tis of ſo pleaſing an aſpect, and happyfying a Nature and Influence, that did but
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106030:111"/>the Profeſſors of it make their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion good, I ſhould not doubt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, but that the lovely and loving holy Jeſus would quickly be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of and be embraced by all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: whereas now, when they come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians, or Chriſtians go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and they ſee the Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Injuſtice, the Wantonneſs, and the almoſt all manner of wickedneſs that attends and adheres to many of their converſations, they are apt, <hi>though illogically enough,</hi> to ſay, this is, or is this their Religion? as they did of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of old, when her beauty was departed from her, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.6. and 2.15. <hi>Is this the City, that men call the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole Earth?</hi> Thus they twit and taunt, clap their hands, hiſs, and wag their head, and abhor the excellency of <hi>Jacob</hi> and beauty of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And truly if the Profeſſors of this <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, lovely beſt, and only ſaving Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> would but do themſelves the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106030:111"/>right to conſider of it, it were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but they would bluſh and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, that ever they ſhould ſo much wrong Religion, by giving ſuch occaſion to reflect ſuch undeſerved reproaches on her: Alas, how will they anſwer it to <hi>Gods-Deputy,</hi> their Conſcience? and if not to that, how to God? for if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and knoweth more by us, than we do by our ſelves, and therefore may much more condemn us. With what faces can ſuch perſons appear before the Throne of God; either here when they pray, or hereafter when they muſt be judged? I will ſay to them, as <hi>Alexander</hi> is ſaid to ſay to a ſouldier of his, and of his Name, <hi>Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lay aſide thy Name, or fight bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Either be not Chriſtians in Name, or be Chriſtians indeed;</hi> for if they have a Name to live, and yet be dead in ſins and treſpaſſes by living in them, they may die in their ſins, and be damned for all their Name. He that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106030:112"/>made them will not ſave them, if they be not new-made and become new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; for <hi>tis not being a creature, but a new creature, that entitles to and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Salvation.</hi> Again,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let me ſay to every Houſe of God by way of dehortation, in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words, which are of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, <hi>&amp;c. Be ye not unequally yoaked with unbelievers; for what fellowſhip hath righteouſneſs with unrighteouſneſs? and what communion hath light with darkneſs? and what concord hath Chriſt with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an Inſidel? and what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement hath the Temple of God with Idols? For ye are the Temple of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God; as God hath ſaid, I will dwel in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Wherefore come cut from among them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to you, and ye ſhall be my Sons and Daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106030:112"/>Having therefore theſe Promiſes, Dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Beloved, Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God. Who hath given us theſe exceeding great and precious promiſes, that by theſe you might be partakers of a divine Nature, having eſcaped the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is in the world through luſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. And you may hear another Voice from Heaven, ſaying, <hi>Come out of her my people, that ye be not parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues,</hi> Revel. 18.4. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore once more in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.14, 15, <hi>&amp;c. My dearly beloved, flee from Idolatry: I ſpeak as to wiſe men, judge ye what I ſay: for why ſhould we provoke the Lord to jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie? are we ſtronger than he?</hi> v. 22. Of old, <hi>God would not permit his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple linſie-woolſie garments, nor to plow with an Oxe and an Aſs, nor to halt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Baal.</hi> Methinks Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, if they remember the Name, ſhould not incline to communion with
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106030:113"/>Papiſts in their Idolatry, which was the ground of our ſeparation from them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I would ſay this by way of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Let no man counterfeit and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble a being holy: <hi>Simulata ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas eſt duplex iniquitas,</hi> to be an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, is to be but a rotten poſt, though double gilt; 'Tis to be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſinner, but one died in grain. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie is a word taken from the Stage, as is well known, and <hi>'tis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a playing, than an acting of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> 'Tis perſonating without being a religious perſon: 'Tis an Art not an Act. And in Religion 'tis true what they ſay of faces, that painting doth not ſo much advance beauty to the eye, as debaſe it to the judgement; and that handſomneſs, which is only artificial, is real deformity. 'Tis not what is ſervice in the eyes of men, or what is celebrated by them for beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but what is ſo in the ſight of God; as the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.22.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:106030:113"/> 4. This by way of Exhortation to the Houſe of God, <hi>be then really, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, and eternally holy;</hi> not for a day, as if ye put on no more but an holy-dayes face and ſine cloths, but at all times and in all things. Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ye do from the higheſt duty of Grace to the loweſt of Nature, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you eat or drink, buy or ſell, as well as whether you hear or pray, <hi>do all to the glory of God.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt hath given himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from <hi>all</hi> iniquity, and purifie to himſelf a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, zealous of and in readineſs to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good word and work, to walk worthy of him to all well-pleaſing, and to ſerve him in righteouſneſs and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all the dayes of our life; <hi>to length of dayes,</hi> or for ever, as 'tis in the Text; and that though the floods lift up their voice and waves, as 'tis a little before the Text, and to which it hath relation. We ſhould be ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to be as holy, as <hi>Abſalom</hi> was fair, and to have as glorious a Name as the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106030:114"/>
                     <hi>Old Temple</hi> had, which was the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the whole Earth, and of which it is ſaid, <hi>That in it every one ſpake of his glory,</hi> or as 'tis in the Margine, <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very whit of it uttereth glory,</hi> viz. to God, whoſe due it is.</p>
                  <p>I do the rather urge this, becauſe <hi>the life of Religion lies in living in it,</hi> and I ſcarce know any thing more wanting than an holy life; profeſſing, hearing, and praying there is great ſtore, but where is <hi>holineſs?</hi> alas, can we find it in our hearts to live by God, and not live to God! Do we love to hear of Chriſtians Dignities, and ſhall we not love to hear of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Duties? of Priviledges, and not of Performances? of Conſolation and not of Converſation Doctrine? Can we lend our ear to hear what God hath done for us? and ſhall we not give that the hearing which is to be done by us? Surely <hi>our deſign in being Chriſtians ſhould be like Gods, not only to ſave our ſelves, but to glorifie him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:106030:114"/>
                  <p> If you will pleaſe to lend me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more of your patience, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſet this Exhortation home by ſome obliging arguments:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Lord of this Houſe, the <hi>Pater-familias,</hi> the Father of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily <hi>is holy;</hi> and as I have already made appear, 'tis his Name, his Work, his Will, his Image, his Nature, and Glory; therefore be ye alſo holy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Your Profeſſion is holy,</hi> and we ſhould not only make a good profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but make it good. The Houſe of God is as I may call it, an <hi>Holy Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> where all are to be holy profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, as well as profeſſors of holineſs. Profeſſion is an engaging thing, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Fight the good fight of Faith, &amp;c. ſeeing thou haſt made a good Profeſſion before many Witneſſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Your Calling is holy,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>He hath called us with an holy calling;</hi> and 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.7. <hi>He hath called us, not to uncleanneſs, but to holineſs.</hi> We are indeed ſaved by Grace, but we
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106030:115"/>are to know and find, that the Grace of God which bringing Salvation, hath appeared to all men, teacheth us to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and withal to live ſoberly, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and godlily in this preſent World; and ſo to look <hi>(or elſe we look in vain)</hi> for the bleſſed hope and glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: for if we learn not Graces teaching, we ſhall never enjoy Graces ſalvation. So that it clearly appears, that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the Chriſtians <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, his Work and Imployment: He is out of his Calling and Element, when he is not converſant in holineſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>God hath provided an Houſe for you hereafter,</hi> as well as made you his Houſe at preſent. Our Saviour a little before his Aſcenſion comforted his Diſciples againſt all their troubles, with this, <hi>That in his Fathers Houſe were many Manſions, and he was going to prepare a place for them,</hi> John 14.1, 2. Yea, God hath prepared for them a City, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. and St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106030:115"/>us upon his knowledge, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>That if the earthly houſe of this Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle were diſſolved, we have a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God,</hi> an Houſe not made with hands, <hi>eternal in the Heavens:</hi> ſo that we ſhall be no loſers but gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by dying: and ſeeing our future houſe is holy, we who profeſs to be Gods Houſe here, ſhould be holy now.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>You ſtudy what becomes your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man,</hi> and its concerns, that not only your perſons but your houſes, and cloths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may all be neat and handſome; and ſome had almoſt as lieve be out of their lives, as out of the faſhion. And ſhall Gods Houſe, ſhall your heart and life be neglected, and left to diſorder and ſhameful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency? Are ye for all beauty but that of holineſs? Shall every thing be adorned, but the Goſpel and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of God our Saviour? <hi>which is adorned by nothing but holineſs,</hi> which is not this or that particular grace, but a complication of all graces, every
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106030:116"/>one link contributing to make it more glorious than a Chain of Gold about your Neck for ornament; as the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi> ſome-where ſpeak by alluſion. I may reaſon it and expoſtulate with you as the Prophet did to them who ſaid, <hi>the time was not come that the Lords Houſe ſhould be built,</hi> Hag. 1.4. <hi>Is it time for you to dwell in your cieled houſes, and this houſe lie waſte?</hi> Oh repair the Houſe of God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>To pretend to holineſs and not to practiſe it, is to be but irreligiouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,</hi> to have the Name of a Saint and to be a ſinner. To ſay of ſuch or ſuch, that they are Saints, and not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is as great a contradiction and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, as to ſay, a man is and is not at the ſame time. In Words to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs God, and in Works to deny him, is to diſown their acknowledgement, to deny their Confeſſion, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their denial of God: <hi>ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency is an unholy Saint.</hi> And on this account it was that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo juſtly ſevere to ſinful profeſſors of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106030:116"/>that he wrote to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> not to company with Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, yet not altogether with the Fornicators of this World, or with the Covetous, or Extortioners, or Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for then muſt they go out of the World: but not to keep company, if any man that's called a Brother, be a Fornicator, or Covetous, or an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, with ſuch an one, no not to eat, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9, 10, 11. Let not ſuch things be once named among you, as becometh Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.3. Let not any of theſe be your Name, for if you be named or called Drunkards, or Unclean, though Chriſtians, <hi>&amp;c. When the Drunkard and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean goes to hell, what will become of the Chriſtian?</hi> The ſin will be of more force to damn, than the Name will be to ſave; For, Know ye not, <hi>that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God? be not deceived, neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, &amp;c.</hi> (ſo living and ſo dying without repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance)
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106030:117"/>
                     <hi>ſhall inherit the Kingdome of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9, 10. And the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle with the like zeal and fervency aſſerts it, and vehemently urgeth it again, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5, 6. <hi>For this ye know, that no Whoremonger, nor unclean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor covetous man who is an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hath any inheritance in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt and of God. Let no man deceive you with vain words</hi> (as if you might be ſaved notwithſtanding your being ſuch) <hi>for becauſe of theſe things cometh the wrath of God on the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience,</hi> though they may by men be called the children of God: <hi>Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. I pray conſider this alſo, That though you may own your ſelves, yet if you be not holy, <hi>God will not own you for his houſe:</hi> He delights indeed in the habitable parts of the Earth, but which are they? not <hi>the Temples made with hands,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 17.24. but the humble, the broken, the pure in heart, as was hinted before:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106030:117"/>and 'tis expreſly ſaid in that Pſalme which ſpeaks of Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>viz.</hi> 16. <hi>That his goodneſs extendeth to the Saints, which are upon the Earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all his delight. Theſe you ſee are the habitable parts of the Earth,</hi> the houſes in which he delights to dwell. But if the houſe of God be defiled, he will forſake it as the Temple of old, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 3.13. <hi>If any man defile or deſtroy the Temple of God, him ſhall God deſtroy, for the Temple of God is holy; let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive himſelf, &amp;c. Communion with God is our Heaven upon Earth, the only thing that makes it worth our while to live.</hi> But what communion hath God with <hi>Belial? If any man ſay that he hath fellowſhip with him, and walks in darkneſs, he lieth; but if we walk in the light as he is in the light, then have we fellowſhip one with another,</hi> 1 John 1.6. As the Devil is diſpoſſeſt when perſons are converted to the faith, the ſtrong man is caſt out, and ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are delivered from the power of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106030:118"/>Satan unto God; ſo when profeſſing perſons do wickedly, eſpecially if they apoſtatize from Faith and Holineſs, God is turn'd out of the houſe which was called his, and will not be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, nor lodge, or ſojourn in an houſe that is ſo polluted with lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and admits the Devil to re-poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Holineſs is an endued Beauty.</hi> The lovers and admirers of this corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real and ſuperficial takingneſs, do oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner woe than wed un-endued Beauty; for their eye and tongue delight, they will complement it, and extract the eſſenſes of wit to give it Elogies even to adoration: but as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of Wiſdome, ſo they of Beauty, <hi>'tis good with an inheritance.</hi> The poor wiſe man was ſo happy, as by his wiſdom to deliver the City, but ſo unhappy as not be regarded, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his poverty, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.15. But the Beauty of Holineſs cannot want regard, nor go un-eſpouſed on this account, for the beſt, the greateſt and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106030:118"/>incorruptible inheritance is hers. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven its ſelf is called the inheritance of the Saints or holy-ones, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. and this inheritance is ſhared among them that are ſanctified, and none elſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. And this inheritance is both Light and Life, Kingdome and Crown of Glory, which fadeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and therefore methinks the great and generous Gallants of this World, as they love to be called, ſhould be in love with and all ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd of Holineſs, ſeeing Beauty and Glory, Honour and Riches meet and center in her, as much and well as they are annexed to her.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. To gather and cloſe up many things together, <hi>Holineſs is the end of all</hi> that God, the Father, Son, and Spirit have done and will do for us from firſt to laſt; as alſo of all the means enjoyn'd <hi>to,</hi> Priviledges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd <hi>on,</hi> Graces wrought <hi>in,</hi> Duties to be done <hi>by</hi> us, Afflictions and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als <hi>wherewith we</hi> are exercis'd: 'Tis <hi>the end</hi> the Father hath <hi>in Electing,</hi>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:106030:119"/>Eph. 1.4. <hi>He hath choſen us in him,</hi> viz. Chriſt, <hi>before the foundation of the World, that we ſhould be</hi> holy <hi>and without blame</hi> before him in love. As of the Fathers Election, ſo is it <hi>the end</hi> of the Sons Redemption of us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26. <hi>He loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might</hi> ſanctifie <hi>and cleanſe it:</hi> and ſo again <hi>Titus</hi> 2.14. <hi>He gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and</hi> purifie <hi>unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> The Office and <hi>Work of the Spirit</hi> is to ſanctifie; and he is called holy, not only as being ſo in himſelf, but for making us ſo by his efficient power, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. God hath choſen you to ſalvation, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through belief of the truth, but <hi>ſanctification</hi> of the Spirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. Elect according to foreknowledge, through <hi>ſanctification</hi> of the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. Such were ſome of you, but ye are <hi>ſanctified, &amp;c.</hi> by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our God. 'Tis <hi>the end of all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> and means, and we ſhould
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106030:119"/>not take up with the means without the end. What is preaching for, but to bring men into, and to build them up in <hi>holineſs? Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. 'Tis <hi>the end of all Dignities</hi> and Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of which the Promiſes are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal; and why are they given us, but (as was ſaid above) that we might perfect <hi>holineſs,</hi> and partake of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature? Why is the great Title of the Sons and Children of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon us? but that we ſhould be followers of, and like to God our Father, as dear Children. 'Tis <hi>the end of all graces</hi> wrought in and exercis'd by us; <hi>of faith,</hi> Acts 15.9. Purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hearts by faith; and <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>them that are ſanctified by faith.</hi> So <hi>of hope,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>And every man that hath this hope in him, purifies himſelf, as he is pure.</hi> So <hi>of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.4. <hi>He that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him:</hi> He hath not learned the truth as 'tis in Jeſus, and therefore
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106030:120"/>his knowledge is but a form of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.20. and knowledge falſly ſo called, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20. 'Tis the end and effect <hi>of love alſo,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. <hi>For this is the love of God, that we keep his Commandments, and they are not grievous. Commands from God who loves us, and to us who love him, cannot be grievous;</hi> if they are ſo, 'tis for want of love in us: for our Saviour tells us, if we love him we will, and they are the lovers and friends of him, who do keep his Commandments. 'Tis <hi>the end</hi> of that great duty <hi>of Prayer;</hi> why or what do we pray for? but that we may be <hi>holy,</hi> and do his will on Earth, as 'tis done in heaven. Surely what the Apoſtle prays for in relation to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 5.23. ſhould be every ones prayer for themſelves, that they may be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied throughout and wholly; and to walk worthy of God to all well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. 'Tis <hi>the end of all Afflictions,</hi> Chaſtenings, and Trials, that we might come out of them like
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106030:120"/>Gold purified, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. that the fruit may be the taking away of ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.9. and for our profit, which is in this, that we might be partakers of his holineſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. Yea, 'tis <hi>the end of all mercies</hi> and deliverances, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74, 75. that being deliver'd out of the hands of our enemies, we might ſerve him in righteouſneſs and and true holineſs, without fear, all the dayes of our life. Yet again, and ſo I conclude, 'Tis <hi>the preparation for, and our glory</hi> in Heaven its ſelf: 'Tis our preparation for the ſight of God; <hi>for without Holineſs, no Man,</hi> how Wiſe and Learned, Rich and Honourable, Fair and Beautiful ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he be, <hi>ſhall ſee the Lord, Heb.</hi> 12. and when we do ſee him, more Holineſs will be the effect of that ſight, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. when he doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear we ſhall be like him, <hi>for we ſhall ſee him as he is;</hi> and this is called Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4. When Chriſt our Life ſhall appear, we ſhall appear with him in Glory; and 'tis for the very
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106030:121"/>thing, <hi>viz. being holy,</hi> that the Church is called <hi>Glorious,</hi> Epheſ. 5.27.</p>
                  <p>Well then, Theſe things being ſo, I intreat you to conſider of what hath been ſaid, and beſeech God to give you Underſtanding in all things; that you may <hi>ſo</hi> Know, as to Believe; <hi>ſo</hi> Believe, as to Love; <hi>ſo</hi> Love, as to Practiſe; <hi>ſo</hi> Practiſe, as to Perfect Holineſs, and be Eternally ſaved: and then I know, that you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and ſing the New Song, even Praiſe to God, and joyn with them that ſay, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with my Text, that <hi>Holineſs becomes thine Houſe, O Lord, for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let all the People ſay, <hi>Amen;</hi> And, as the <hi>Arabick,</hi> adds, <hi>Allelujah.</hi>
